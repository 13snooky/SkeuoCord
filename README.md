SkeuoCord gives Discord a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of its interface, from channels to the Server Boost page, is themed for a complete look. Both dark and light themes *(including the Dark Sidebar option for the light theme)* are supported. 

*To customize user avatar border radiuses, change the related variables in the theme import file. You can set all to 999px for circle avatars.*

*SkeuoCord requires English to be the selected language for button icon theming. If button icons aren't themed for you, change your client language to English.*

*If you don't want to use SkeuoCord's brand color replacement, use SkeuoCord_NoBrandReplace.theme.css from SkeuoCord's GitHub repo.*
