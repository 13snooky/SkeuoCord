# SkeuoCord
### A complete skeuomorphic overhaul for Discord

SkeuoCord is a theme that gives Discord's UI a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of the interface, ranging from the chat UI to the Server Boost page, has been themed for a complete look. Both Dark and Light modes are supported and the general interface for both are finalized as of Release Candidate 2. 

*The Dark Sidebar option for Light Mode isn't supoorted as of now, as the issue persists even after the removal of class normalization. I'll try to add support for it in the future.*

You can contact me on Discord *(JustRedWeegee#3625)* about requests you have/bugs you find.

*Theming the web app via extensions like Stylish and non-BandagedBD methods are fully compatible as of Release Candidate 2.*
