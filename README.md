## A complete skeuomorphic overhaul for Discord

SkeuoCord gives Discord a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of its interface, ranging from the chat UI to the Server Boost page, has been themed for a complete look. Both Dark and Light modes *(Including Dark Sidebar for Light Mode)* are implemented.

*SkeuoCord requires English to be the selected language for custom button icon changes. If custom button icons aren't displaying for you, switch your client language to English.*
