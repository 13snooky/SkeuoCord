# SkeuoCord
### A complete skeuomorphic theme for Discord

SkeuoCord is a theme that'll give Discord's UI a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of the interface, ranging from the chat UI to the Server Boost page, has been themed for a complete look. Both Dark and Light modes are supported and the general interface for both are finalized. The Dark Sidebar option for Light Mode isn't functional yet. You can also set your Discord shortcuts' icon to the one provided for a matching look.

You can contact me on Discord *(JustRedWeegee#3625)* about requests you have/bugs you find.

*The theme could also be used for theming of the web app via extensions like Stylish, but support isn't planned for such uses and there might be bugs that are not present in the desktop app.*
