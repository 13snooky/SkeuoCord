# SkeuoCord
### A complete skeuomorphic overhaul for Discord

SkeuoCord is a theme that gives Discord's UI a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of the interface, ranging from the chat UI to the Server Boost page, has been themed for a complete look. Both Dark and Light modes *(Including Dark Sidebar for Light Mode)* are supported and the general interface for both are finalized. 

You can contact me on Discord *(JustRedWeegee#3625)* about requests you have/bugs you find.

*Theming the web app via extensions like Stylish and non-BandagedBD methods are fully compatible.*
