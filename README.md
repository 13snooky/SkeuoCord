### A complete skeuomorphic overhaul for Discord

SkeuoCord is a theme that gives Discord's UI a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of the interface, ranging from the chat UI to the Server Boost page, has been themed for a complete look. Both Dark and Light modes *(Including Dark Sidebar for Light Mode)* are supported.

*SkeuoCord requires English to be the selected language for custom button icon changes. If you are having issues with certain button icons not displaying, switch your client language to English.*

*You can open the theme's CSS in any text editor to adjust text shadow intensity/color for both modes.* 

*Theming the web app via extensions like Stylish and non-BandagedBD methods are fully compatible.*
