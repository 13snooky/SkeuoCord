### A skeuomorphic theme for BetterDiscord

SkeuoCord gives both the Dark and Light modes a skeuomorphic look. The general interface for both modes have mostly been finalized. The Dark Sidebar option for Light Mode isn't functional yet. You can also set your Discord shortcuts' icon to the one provided for a matching look.

You can contact me on Discord *(JustRedWeegee#3625)* about requests you have/bugs you find.

*The theme could also be used for theming of the web app via extensions like Stylish, but support isn't planned for such uses and there might be bugs that are not present in the desktop app.*
