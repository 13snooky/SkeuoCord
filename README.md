# SkeuoCord
### A skeuomorphic theme for BetterDiscord.

SkeuoCord gives both the Dark and Light modes a skeuomorphic look. Both modes have mostly been finalized as of build 5219.

You can contact me on Discord(JustRedWeegee#3625) about requests you have/bugs you find.

*The theme is also known to support the theming of the web app via Stylish, but support isn't planned for such uses and there might be bugs that are not present in the desktop app.*
