# SkeuoCord
A skeuomorphic theme for BetterDiscord.

SkeuoCord gives both the Dark and Light modes a skeuomorphic look. 
The theme is a work-in-progress, although the general UI for both modes is finalized and ready for use. 
If you have a request/find bugs, you can contact me on Discord(JustRedWeegee#3625) about it.
The theme is also known to support the theming of the web app via Stylish, but support isn't planned for such uses and there might be bugs that are not present in the desktop app.
