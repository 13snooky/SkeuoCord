# SkeuoCord
### A complete skeuomorphic theme for Discord

SkeuoCord is a theme that gives Discord's UI a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of the interface, ranging from the chat UI to the Server Boost page, has been themed for a complete look. Both Dark and Light modes are supported and the general interface for both are finalized. 
*The Dark Sidebar option for Light Mode won't be supported as of now due to the theme relying heavily on class normalization. I'll look into removing that in the future. You can also set your Discord shortcuts' icon to the one provided for a matching look.*

You can contact me on Discord *(JustRedWeegee#3625)* about requests you have/bugs you find.

*Due to class normalization, SkeuoCord is broken for use with the web app.*
