SkeuoCord gives Discord a skeuomorphic overhaul. Almost every part of its interface, from channels to the Server Boost page, is themed for a complete look. Both dark and light themes *(including the Dark Sidebar option for the light theme)* are supported.

*SkeuoCord requires English to be the selected language for button icon theming. If button icons aren't themed for you, change your client language to English.*

*If you don't want to use SkeuoCord's brand color replacement, use SkeuoCord (No Brand Color Replacement).theme.css from SkeuoCord's GitHub repo.*
